# 1. Abstraction aur Modularity
* Abstraction: Jab hum sirf ye focus karte hain “kya karna hai”, na ki “kaise karna hai”.

* Modularity: Complex problem ko *chhote-chhote* independent subtasks mein *todna*, **jise alag-alag solve kiya ja sake.**

* Example:

  High-level task: First 1000 prime numbers print karna.

  Pehle hum sirf sochte hain kya chahiye, kaise karna hai ye baad mein decide karte hain (ye abstraction hai).

# 2. Stepwise Refinement
`Stepwise refinement ka matlab hai:`
1. Start karo ek high-level task se.

1. Usko chhote subtasks mein todte jao.

1. Har subtask tab tak refine karo jab tak wo basic operations se implement ho sake.

# Key Points
* Abstraction → “kya karna hai” pe focus karo, details chhupao.
* Modularity → Problem ko independent parts mein tod do.
* Stepwise refinement → Task ko progressively chhote, implementable steps mein todte jao.

# Data Refinement
- Pehle simple array se kaam chal raha tha.
- Jab statement me transactions show karne ki requirement aayi, hume data structure badalna pada.
- Ye data refinement hai → data ki representation ko better karna taaki naye tasks handle ho saken.
- Is refinement se baaki modules ka code bhi modify karna pada.

# Modular software development
- Divide and conquer is one of the fundamental technique
- It is important to divide large and complex programs into smaller and manageable  parts called functions or procedures, that can be solved  independently.
- Use refinement to divide the program into functions or procedures.
- These functions or procedures called to generate the solutions.
- The solutions generated by these functions are combined to provide the overall solution for the main program. 

**Prototyping** is a development method, involves `implementing smaller parts of a program in a simple way to understand if the design will really work.` Then, after the design has been tested in some way, `one can improve parts of the program independently by reimplementing them.`

**There are two important concepts in modular program development: interfaces and specifications.**

1. Interface: It is a description of the parts of a component that are visible to other program components.

1. Specification: It is a description of the behavior of a component, as observable through its interface.
